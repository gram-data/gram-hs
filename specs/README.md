# Feature Specifications (Historical)

**Purpose**: Historical development artifacts documenting the feature development sequence

## Overview

The `specs/` directory contains feature specifications created during development. These documents represent the **historical development sequence** and may contain outdated information as features evolved.

## Current Specifications

For **current, authoritative specifications**, see:
- **[Reference Documentation](../docs/reference/SPECIFICATION.md)** - Current feature specifications with implementation status
- **[Feature Specifications](../docs/reference/features/)** - Detailed feature-by-feature specifications
- **[Architecture](../docs/reference/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Design principles

## Historical Context

These specifications document:
- The development sequence (Feature 001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Original design decisions and rationale
- Evolution of features over time
- Implementation plans and task breakdowns

**Note**: Some specifications may be outdated because:
- Later features changed the design
- Implementation details evolved
- Features were deferred or simplified

## For Language Porters

If you're porting this library:
1. **Start with**: [Porting Guide](../docs/reference/PORTING-GUIDE.md)
2. **Reference**: [Current Specifications](../docs/reference/SPECIFICATION.md)
3. **Use historical specs**: Only for understanding development sequence and design evolution

## For Library Users

If you're using the library:
- See **[User Documentation](../docs/users/README.md)** instead

## For Developers

These specifications are useful for:
- Understanding why features were implemented in a particular order
- Seeing design evolution and trade-offs
- Learning from the development process
