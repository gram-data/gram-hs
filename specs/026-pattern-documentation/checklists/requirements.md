# Specification Quality Checklist: Comprehensive Pattern Documentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers found in the specification
- The specification appropriately focuses on documentation needs and user learning outcomes
- User stories are prioritized appropriately: P1 for foundational concepts, P2 for practical applications, P3 for advanced topics
- Success criteria are measurable using test reader evaluation metrics (percentage of readers successfully understanding concepts)
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic, focusing on user understanding rather than implementation details
- Use cases are clearly identified: knowledge graphs (Route 66), agentic systems (workflows, reasoning traces), and other domains
- Documentation scope is clearly bounded: comprehensive user guide progressing from basic to advanced concepts
- Edge cases address important documentation concerns: different user backgrounds, balancing simplicity/completeness, multiple languages
- Dependencies are clearly identified with all prerequisites marked as complete
- Assumptions appropriately document documentation format, organization, and accessibility considerations
